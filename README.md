# SharpestMinds Capstone Data: Raw Data repository

I am creating a dedicated GitHub repo of the raw data for my SM Capstone project. This allows me to demonstrate my ETL process on Google Colab, and thereby save some space on my G-Drive as well. My aim is also to decrease the size of my main project repository, and to keep track of my data sources, listed below.
